    "# A Perfect Number\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1 MD7 of Season 76 of Learned League asked about perfect numbers. I vaguely recall having coded a simple program for determining if a given number is a perfect number. Thus inspired, after having pondered a solution somewhat, I decided to do a little recreational coding. \n",
    "\n",
    "I probably was mistaken. However, I came up with a two-bit* solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Not bits as in computing bits, bits as in the value/quality of the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief definition of a perfect number\n",
    "- A perfect number is an integer *n* such that n = sum of its divisors (not including the number itself)\n",
    "- Examples: 6 = 1+ 2+ 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief outline of a solution:\n",
    "1) Given number x, determine divisors of x\n",
    "2) Sum divisors of x if x == x, we're good. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Solution (Might not be highly readable)"
